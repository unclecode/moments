At Kidocode, we’re changing the way people learn and work together. Through computational thinking and a hunger for fun, we’ve found a way to make learning personalized and relevant for every single child in the modern era.


The problem 🤕
Too many kids, are being put through an ancient, industrialized education model that isn’t relevant anymore.
But it doesn’t have to be that way. As the wise benjamin franklin once said... 👇



“Tell me and I forget.
Teach me and I remember.
Involve me and I learn.”
- Benjamin Franklin
